# Obatin App

Swamedikasi is self-medication using over-the-counter medicines without a doctor's prescription. Unfortunately, Lack of knowledge about Swamedikasi and medicine use etiquette is very high in Indonesia.

We can take Amoxicillin for example, which is often used to treat various diseases. While amoxicillin itself is an antibiotic that belongs to the hard medicine class. This is also related to knowledge of medicine use which is often not clearly given. For example, the use of antibiotics must be consumed until they run out so antibiotic resistance doesnâ€™t occur.

Obatin is an application that will help users with self-medication that has a chatbot as its main feature. The chatbot can answer user questions and give recommendations or solutions based on the user's health problem. With this application, we hope that we can help people to do self-medication in the right way.
